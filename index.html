                <header><h2>More observations on a bad investment</h2></header>
                <p>Weeks after the previous post, I've put some more time into this project. Below a crude representation of the results.</p>

                <p>What you're seeing is the evolution of the parts which depend on the markets.<br>
                Every month there is a jump which corresponds to the deposits made. During the month, you can see how each part varied.<br>
                Not knowing much yet regarding financial markets, I can't reach any certain conclusion. However it seems to me that FR000444275 is the best investment out of the four. It's the only one which seems able to end a month higher than it started</p>
                <p>Next, I will be working on automating the retrieval of data and generation of this graph. In the coming weeks, I will aim to compare the existing parts with other hypothetical ones.</p>

              <header><h2>Understanding a bad investment</h2></header>
              <p>In this section, I will set out to break down and undestand the variations of a Life Insurance investment and ultimately see what the holder should change to optimize it.</p>
              <p>This Life Insurance has been set up at the end of May 2017.<br>
                The holder has deposited 500 euros on it monthly between May 2017 and June 2017.<br>
                Here is the breakdown of the portfolio :
              </p>
              <div  class="breackdown"><script type="text/javascript"charset="utf-8" src="scripts/monetBreackdown.js"></script></div>
              <p>At this point, this doesn't not seem to mean anything. What we need to do to expand this analysis is to put numbers in front of those.<br>
                Remember the 500 euros deposits. After 13 deposits, one could expect around <strong>6500</strong> euros as a value. However, the actual value of the account is around <strong>6350</strong> euros, varying daily.<br>
                Many reasons could explain this. You might think about variations of the market or inability of the analyst to read numbers. Actually, there is some information, you are missing. Each and every deposit has a 2% fee. Meaning, 500 euros of are effectively reduced to 480 euros.<br>
                Quick calculation, the expected value comes to <strong>6240</strong>.That is 100 euros less than the actual value.<br>
                Conclusion : the investment appears positive, however the fees strongly impact the actual value.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>As an example. Stopping all deposits and assuming the same returns <em>((6350-6240)/6240)*100</em> = <strong>1.76% a year</strong>, it would take approximately one and a half year to reach the investment of 6500 and not only have positive returns, but also making the fees meaningless.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Note that I took some shortcuts in the analysis above. First, I assumed the return was over a year whereas the amount invested changed monthly and the different parts of the portfolio changed daily. Secondly, not only I assumed that nothing will change in the next year, I also assumed that at the end of the year, all these parameters will bring us to the same return.<br>
                You might be wondering why I detailed the portfolio earlier, if I went on and ignored it. The next article will focus on what really happened during the year using the data for each part of the portfolio.
